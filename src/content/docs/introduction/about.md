This is a comprehensive, structured tutorial of the Raku programming language that intends to cover (almost) every concept in both the Raku programming language as well as many concepts specific to the Rakudo compiler such as metaprogramming.

## Why another Raku tutorial?

- Many constructs in the Raku language are not the most well-documented: a major example of this is *slangs*, a mechanism that allows you to modify the Raku language's parser [in order to introduce new syntax](https://raku.land/zef:elcaro/Slang::Otherwise), [modify existing syntax to allow for new kinds of indentifiers](https://raku.land/zef:raku-community-modules/Slang::Piersing), or in some cases [outright embed other languages within the Raku language itself](https://raku.land/zef:tony-o/Slang::SQL).
- Most Raku tutorials aren't comprehensive enough. Trying to make tutorials for a language like Raku, that dwarfs its competitors Python and Ruby in terms of available features, is naturally going to be daunting. Of all the [Learn X in Y minutes tutorials](https://learnxinyminutes.com/raku/), Raku has the longest tutorial because it has the most syntax constructs of any language.
